###
Note that this project requires ffmpeg installed on the host.

If its a container or just directly on host system, just have ffmpeg installed

And if its on a venv, also do this: in pyenv.vfg set include-system-site-packages = true
Do this only once you installed requirements, or pip packages install to host instead
and set that to flase for regenrating requirements!!!

####
Python version used is v3.10.6
Use this if you want to ensure compatibility.
On python versions from 3.11, pytorch - a crucial python package used in this project
, is not supported at all!!! So the project won't run above this version.
